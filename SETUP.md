# Payfirst Setup Guide üöÄ

Turn any link into instant crypto revenue with Payfirst!

## TL;DR - Quickest Start

1. **Install:** `npm install`
2. **Create `.env` file:** Just `PORT=8080` and `NODE_ENV=development` (no API keys needed!)
3. **Run backend:** `npm start` 
4. **Open frontend:** Double-click `frontend/index.html` or use Live Server
5. **Test:** Click "Try Demo" button!

---

## Quick Start (Detailed)

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Create Environment File

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with these contents:

```env
# Minimum to run (everything is simulated)
PORT=8080
NODE_ENV=development
```

**That's it!** The current code simulates everything, so it will run without API keys.

For production, see [ENV_KEYS.md](./ENV_KEYS.md) for what you need:
- Coinbase CDP keys (for real wallets)
- BNB Chain RPC URL (for real blockchain verification)
- Daimo Pay - NO API KEY needed (it's just a package)

üìñ **Full env guide:** See `ENV_KEYS.md` for details on each variable.

### 4. Run the Server

```bash
# Development mode (with auto-reload)
npm run dev

# OR production mode
npm start
```

The API will be available at: `http://localhost:8080`

---

## Testing the API

### Test the Health Endpoint

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/
```

You should see:
```json
{
  "message": "Payfirst API is live",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "powered_by": "@CoinbaseDev + x402"
}
```

### Create a Demo Paywall

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/create-paywall \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://example.com/article", "price": "2.99"}'
```

You should see:
```json
{
  "paywall_id": "abc123",
  "paywall_link": "https://payfirst.app/abc123",
  "price": "2.99",
  "currency": "USDC",
  "status": "created"
}
```

### Test x402 Protocol

Open in browser or use curl:
```bash
curl -i http://localhost:8080/x402
```

---

## Frontend Setup

The frontend is a simple HTML page. Just **double-click `frontend/index.html`** to open it in your browser!

Or use VS Code Live Server:
1. Install **"Live Server"** extension
2. Right-click `frontend/index.html` ‚Üí **"Open with Live Server"**

### Test the Frontend

1. Make sure your backend API is running (run `npm start`)
2. Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser
3. Click **"Try Demo"** button
4. You should see a JSON response with a paywall ID and link

## For Production Integration

When you're ready to integrate real blockchain payments, you'll need:

### 1. Coinbase CDP Account
- Sign up at: https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/
- Get your API credentials
- Add to `.env`:
```env
COINBASE_API_KEY=your_key_here
COINBASE_API_SECRET=your_secret_here
```

### 2. BNB Chain RPC
- Use public RPC or get your own from Infura/Alchemy
- Add to `.env`:
```env
BNB_CHAIN_RPC_URL=https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/
```

### 3. Daimo Pay (for multi-crypto support) - NO API KEY NEEDED!

Daimo Pay is installed as a package, not an API service:

```bash
# Install Daimo Pay SDK
npm install @daimo/pay wagmi viem@^2.22.0 @tanstack/react-query
```

See [Daimo Pay Docs](https://paydocs.daimo.com/quickstart) for integration. It's a React component that handles cross-chain payments automatically.

### 4. USDC Contract Address
```env
USDC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x8AC76a51cc950d9822D68b83fE1Ad97B32Cd580d
```

---

## Common Issues

### Issue: "Cannot use import statement outside a module"

**Solution:** Add this to `package.json`:
```json
{
  "type": "module"
}
```

### Issue: Port already in use

**Solution:** Change `PORT` in `.env` to a different port like `8081`

### Issue: CORS errors in frontend

**Solution:** Make sure `cors` middleware is enabled in `api/paywall.js` (it already is!)

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Run the basic server (current state - simulates everything)
2. üîÑ Integrate Coinbase CDP for wallet creation
3. üîÑ Add BNB Chain transaction verification
4. üîÑ Integrate Daimo Pay for multi-crypto support
5. üîÑ Add database for persistent paywall storage
6. üîÑ Implement passkey authentication
7. üîÑ Deploy to production

---

## Current Limitations

- ‚ö†Ô∏è All paywall creation is simulated (no database storage)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Payment verification is simulated (no blockchain interaction)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Wallet creation is mocked (no actual Coinbase CDP integration)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No passkey authentication yet
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No multi-crypto payment processing yet

The skeleton is ready - now integrate the real services!
